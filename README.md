Project Overview

This project aims to design and create a full stack web program with React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Next.js. The applications includes authentication and authorizations for providing recipes to UGA students. Campus Craving is designed to provide students with full recipes that can be used to make easy dishes. Being a college student can be difficult, especially when you have no meal plan or finances to pay for food everyday. Hopefully, this makes dietary challenges UGA students face seem easier to tackle head on.
